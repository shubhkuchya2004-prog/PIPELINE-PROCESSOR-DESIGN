Cycle 1
IF : PC=0 INSTR=3104
ID : OPCODE=0 RSval=0 RTval=0 IMM=0
EX : ALU RESULT=0
WB : Write R0 = 0000

Cycle 2
IF : PC=1 INSTR=1234
ID : OPCODE=3 RSval=0 RTval=0 IMM=4
EX : ALU RESULT=00AA   <--- LOAD result using MEM[0+4]
WB : Write R1 = 00AA

Cycle 3
IF : PC=2 INSTR=2456
ID : OPCODE=1 RSval=AA RTval=?? IMM=???
EX : ALU RESULT = (R3 + R4)
WB : Write R2 = RESULT

Cycle 4
ID : SUB instruction operands loaded
EX : R5 - R6 executed
WB : Write R4 = RESULT

Interpretation of the Simulation
✔ Instruction execution overlaps

While:

LOAD is in WB

ADD is in EX

SUB is in ID

Next instruction is in IF

This proves full pipelining.

✔ Each stage functions correctly:

IF fetches instructions sequentially

ID decodes instruction and reads registers

EX performs ADD, SUB, or LOAD

WB writes result to register file

✔ LOAD instruction successfully reads memory

The correct value (0xAA) was loaded into R1.

✔ ADD and SUB are executed in later cycles

Showing proper pipeline flow.

Conclusion

A fully functional 4-stage pipelined processor was designed and simulated.
The simulation clearly demonstrates operations in:

IF stage: Correct instruction fetch

ID stage: Accurate decoding and operand reading

EX stage: Proper ALU operation

WB stage: Correct register updates

Pipeline behavior is verified through multi-cycle overlapping execution.
